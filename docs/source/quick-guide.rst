Quick guide
==========

In this section, we briefly show how to use the different class methods in 2Danalysis:
`Cumulative2D, Voronoi2D` are intended to project and visualize biophysical membrane properties in a per-grid two-dimensional fashion.  
`PackingDefects` is suited to easily compute packing defects for a membrane & allows further quantitative analysis of the resutls. 
Finally, `BioPolymer2D` is intended to enable analysis of adsorption mechanisms of biopolymers, i.e. nucleic acids, proteins, and glycans, at interacting surfaces (biological or physical)
These can be used individually or combined depending on the system of study & research questions.
